### Cat Gang SQL

The database was created as part of a university assignment, representing an imaginative and fictional reality where cats live in organized gangs or tribes. Each tribe has its own unique hierarchy and specific resources, such as rats, which serve as their primary sustenance or commodities. The cats within each tribe have distinct roles or jobs, contributing to their community's overall functioning and survival. Additionally, every cat has its own set of enemies, leading to frequent confrontations and conflicts. These encounters are recorded as "INCYDENTY" (incidents), reflecting the dynamic and often turbulent interactions between cats and other animals.
